> ⚠️ **Linux & Windows Support**
>
> This application is intended **for Debian-based (DEB/APT) Linux distributions** — for example **Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS**, and other Ubuntu/Debian derivatives. Windows is also supported but requires packaging into an executable.
>
> The application depends on **APT/DEB tooling and packages**, so it is **not expected to work out-of-the-box** on non‑Debian distros such as **Arch (pacman), Fedora (dnf), openSUSE (zypper)**, etc.
> 
> To package the application for Windows, use the following command:
> 
> ```bash
> pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name "LumenVideoGrabber" --add-data "dist;dist" --add-data "public;public" app.py
> ```
> **Note**: On Windows, `add-data` uses `;` separator, while on Linux/Mac it uses `:`.
